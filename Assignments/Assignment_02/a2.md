#Part A: Analysis:

Given the SortedTable class:
```python


class SortedTable:

	# packaging the key-value pair into one object
	class Record:
		def __init__(self, key, value):

Analyze the functions in the above code that is listed below with respect to the number of records in the table.  Provide the final answer (in big-O notation) into the table.  Show your rough work by doing a proper analysis below the summary table of the functions

## Let n represent the number of records in the table.
## Let T(n) represent the number of operations necessary to perform the function.

## Summary table

| Function | run time with respect to number of records in table | 
|---|---|
|def insert(self, key, value):| O(n^2) |
|def modify(self, key, value):| O(n) |
|def remove(self, key): | O(n) |
|def search(self, key):| O(n) |
|def capacity(self):| O(1) |
|def __len__(self):| O(n) |

## Analysis of 	def insert(self, key, value):

```python
def insert(self, key, value):
	if (self.search(key)!=None): # O(n) + 1
		return False # 1

	if(len(self) == self.cap):	# 2
		# increase the capacity if list is full
		new_table = [None for i in range(self.cap*2)] # 2n + 3
		for i in range(self.cap):  # n
			new_table[i]=self.the_table[i] # n + 2
		self.the_table = new_table # 1
		self.cap *= 2 # 1


	self.the_table[len(self)]=self.Record(key,value)
	size = len(self)
	for i in range (0,size-1):
		for j in range(0,size-1-i): # 3 + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ...... 1
			if(self.the_table[j].key>self.the_table[j+1].key): # 4
				tmp=self.the_table[j] # 2
				self.the_table[j]=self.the_table[j+1] # 4
				self.the_table[j+1]=tmp # 3
	return True
```
Worst Case:
T(n) =  O(n) + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2n + 3 + n + n + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + [(n - 1) + (n - 2) + ....... 1] + 4 + 2 + 4 + 3
T(n) = O(n) + 27 + 4n + n/2[(n - 1) + 1]
T(n) = O(n) + O(n^2)
T(n) = O(n)


## Analysis of def modify(self, key, value):
``` python
def modify(self, key, value):
		i = 0														# 1
		while (i < len(self) and self.the_table[i].key != key):     # n + 4
			i+=1													# n
		if(i==len(self)):											# 2n
			return False											
		else:
			self.the_table[i].value = value							# n
			return True												# 1
```
Worst Case:
T(n) = 1 + n + 4 + n + 2n + 1 + n
T(n) = 5n + 6
T(n) is O(n)


## Analysis of def remove(self, key):

```python
def remove(self, key):
	i = 0													# 1
	size = len(self)										# 1
	while (i < size and self.the_table[i].key != key):		# n + 3
		i+=1												# n
	if(i==size):											# n
		return False										# 1
	while(i+1 < size):										# (n - 1) + 2
		self.the_table[i]=self.the_table[i+1]				# 4 * (n - 1)
		i+=1												# 1 * (n - 1)
	self.the_table[i] = None								# 2
	return True												# 1
```
Worst Case:
T(n) = 1 + 1 + n + 3 + n + n + n - 1 + 2 + 4n - 4 + n - 1 + 2 + 1 <br />
T(n) = 9 + 7n <br />
T(n) = O(n)

## Analysis of def search(self, key):

```python
def search(self, key):
		i = 0 	# 1
		size = len(self)	# 1 + 1
		while  i < size and self.the_table[i].key != key : # n + 3
			i+=1    	# n
		if i==size: 	# n
			return None # 1
		else:
			return self.the_table[i].value # 1
```

Worst case: 
T(n) = 1 + 2 + n + 3 + n + n + 1 <br />
T(n) = 7 + 3n <br />
T(n) is O(n)

## Analysis of def capacity(self):

```python 
def capacity(self):
		return self.cap # 1
```
T(n) = 1 <br />
T(n) is O(1)

## Analysis of def __len__(self):
```python
	def __len__(self): 
		i = 0			# 1
		count = 0		# 1
		while(i < len(self.the_table)): # n
			if(self.the_table[i]!=None): # 2n
				count+=1 	# n
			i+=1	# n
		return count # 1
```
Worst case:
T(n) = 5n + 3 <br />
T(n) is O(n)

# Part B: Improvements

* Suggestion 1: 
Currently, the search function uses a linear search to find the key in the table, which has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case. Instead, you can improve the search efficiency by using binary search, which has a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case for a sorted list. However, for binary search to work, the table must be sorted based on keys.

* Suggestion 2:
The insert function currently performs a linear search to check if the key already exists in the table. This has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case. To improve this, you can use a Python dictionary to store the key-value pairs, which offers constant-time average case lookup.


# Part E: Reflections


## Reflection for Arina Kolodeznikova

### 1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.

I was mainly responsible for developing the logic of and implementing the hash table,
which resolves the collisions with linear probing + tombstoning (1st part of Part C).
Helped my teammates with the remove function for the no tombstoning part.
Additionaly, I was actively participating in the function analysis (Part A and B).

---

### 2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment

For me, the most significant learning outcome of this assignment was mastering 
the efficient implementation of hash tables in Python, as getting hands-on experience 
with hash tables helped me to fully understand the underlying logic.

---

### 3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?

Arguably, one of the most challenging parts was implementing the remove()
function in LinearProbingNoTS class.

Originally, our function didn't account for the cases where the clusters consisted 
of the records with different hash indexes, which led to the failure to properly move the records
after one got deleted.

It happened because the loop stopped on the first encountered element with a different hash index.

---

#### Our initial loop condition: 

```python
while self.hash_table[curr_index] is not None and (hash(self.hash_table[curr_index].key) % self.cap) == hashed_index:
```
---

Moreover, it was particularly hard to determine what was causing the unexpected code behaviour
(due to the logic of the in-built hash function, the code broke in different places, so it was 
impossible to properly debug.) 

To solve this issue, we have decided to write our own hash function with the logic that generates 
the same hash with every run. It helped us to determine, that the issue we were facing was caused 
by the reason stated above.

Then, to fix the logic we used the condition suggested in the video by Catherine Leung, 
written the pseudocode, and finally, implemented the fixed logic.

---

The remove function we came up with:

```python

	def remove(self, key):
		hashed_index = hash(key) % self.cap
		curr_index = hashed_index
		while self.hash_table[curr_index] is not None:
			if self.hash_table[curr_index].key == key:
				self.hash_table[curr_index] = None
				empty_index = curr_index
				next_index = (empty_index + 1) % self.cap
				while self.hash_table[next_index] is not None:
					if (empty_index >= hash(self.hash_table[next_index].key) % self.cap) and (empty_index < next_index):
						self.hash_table[empty_index] = self.hash_table[next_index]
						self.hash_table[next_index] = None
						empty_index = next_index
					next_index = (next_index + 1) % self.cap
				self.elements -= 1
				return True		
			curr_index = (curr_index + 1) % self.cap
		return False
```

### 1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.

I was assigned to complete the LinearProbingNoTS class implementation, which is the second part of Part C. This class represents a hash table that uses linear probing to handle collisions. Additionally, I assisted my teammates in implementing the LinearProbingTS class, which is another hash table implementation that uses linear probing but incorporates thread safety (TS) mechanisms. Apart from this, I also participated in the Part A + Part B function analysis.

---

### 2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment

Throughout the project, I gained a profound understanding of hash tables through hands-on experience in their implementation. I learned various collision resolution techniques, with a particular focus on linear probing, both with and without tombstones.

---

### 3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?

The most challenging aspect of the assignment was implementing the remove() function of the LinearProbingNoTS class. Initially, we faced an issue with the logic, as we iterated until we encountered an element with a different hash index or an empty space, causing the loop to terminate prematurely. In linear probing, however, an element with the same hashed index may be located further down the table due to available space.<br />

``` python
while self.hash_table[next_index] is not None and (hash(self.hash_table[curr_index].key) % self.cap) == hashed_index:
	self.hash_table[empty_index] = self.hash_table[next_index]
	self.hash_table[next_index] = None
	empty_index = next_index
	next_index = (next_index + 1) % self.cap
```
To address this, we devised an alternative approach. We realized that we needed to consider whether the empty index falls between the hashed index of the current key and the index of the key itself. By making this adjustment and introducing an additional if statement, we were able to ensure the correct functioning of the remove() function.<br />

``` python
while self.hash_table[next_index] is not None:
	if (empty_index >= hash(self.hash_table[next_index].key) % self.cap) and (empty_index < next_index):
		self.hash_table[empty_index] = self.hash_table[next_index]
		self.hash_table[next_index] = None
		empty_index = next_index
	next_index = (next_index + 1) % self.cap
```


# Reflection for Nabeeha Siddiqui

### 1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.

I was assigned to complete the Graph class implementation in Part D. This part required for me to apply the knowledge and understanding gained through the lectures on Graphs and their implementation. Furthermore, I assisted with the Part A and Part B analysis.

---

### 2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?

During my implementation of the Graph class, I learnt the different methods implemented in order to make a function Graph data structure. 

---

### 3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?

The most complcated part in my part of the Assignment was implementing the add_edge function. Overall, compared to the rest of the assignment, the Graph class was straightforward to implement. The most complications I was facing was through ensuring the logic made sense and the right validation checks were taking place. 

In order to tackle this, trial and error of various versions of this function was what got me through this. I landed on the following as the correct logic for the add_edge function.

```python
	def add_edge(self, from_idx, to_idx, weight=1):
		if 0 <= from_idx < self.number_of_verts and 0 <= to_idx < self.number_of_verts:
			for vertex_edges in self.adjacency_list[from_idx]:
				if vertex_edges[0] == to_idx:
					return False
			
			self.adjacency_list[from_idx].append((to_idx, weight))
			return True
		else:
			return False
